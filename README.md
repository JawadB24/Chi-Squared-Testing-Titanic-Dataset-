# Chi-Squared-Testing-Titanic-Dataset-
- Filled null values for quantitative and categorical variables, using both mean and mode imputations
- Visualized the age distribution of passengers, along with the relationship between social class and survival rate using barplots in Seaborn
- Implemented the chi-squared test using SciPy, concluding with 95% confidence that the survival rate and passenger class are significantly related, as the calculated chi-squared statistic is far greater than the critical value, thus rejecting the null hypothesis
